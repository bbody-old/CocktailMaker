		<percentage>40</percentage>
		<comment>Light rum (also known as "silver" or "white" rum), is a
			dry, light-bodied rum, light in color and lightly sweet in flavor. It
			is produced from sugarcane juice and molasses, and normally has a
			short aging period.
			Unlike other various rums which are aged in charred oak casks, light rum is
			simply aged in plain oak casks or stainless steel tanks, so it
			remains clear.
